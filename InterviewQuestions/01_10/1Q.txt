A Company parses logs of online store user transactions/activity to flag fraudulent activity.

The log file is represented as an Array of arrays. The arrays consist of the following data:

[ <# of transactions>]

For example:

[345366 89921 45]

Note: the data is space delimited

So, the log data would look like:

[
[345366 89921 45],
[029323 38239 23]
...
]
Write a function to parse the log data to find distinct users that meet or cross a certain threshold.

The function will take in 2 inputs:
logData: Log data in form an array of arrays

threshold: threshold as an integer

Output:
It should be an array of userids that are sorted.

If same userid appears in the transaction as userid1 and userid2, it should count as one occurrence, not two.

Example:
Input:
logData:

[
[345366 89921 45],
[029323 38239 23],
[38239 345366 15],
[029323 38239 77],
[345366 38239 23],
[029323 345366 13],
[38239 38239 23]
...
]
threshold: 3

Output: [345366 , 38239, 029323]
Explanation:
Given the following counts of userids, there are only 3 userids that meet or exceed the threshold of 3.

345366 -4 , 38239 -5, 029323-3, 89921-1
